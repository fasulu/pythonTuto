# ************  logging()

"""     
		Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some 
  software runs. Logging is important for software developing, 
  debugging, and running. If you donâ€™t have any logging record and 
  your program crashes, there are very few chances that you detect 
  the cause of the problem. And if you detect the cause, it will 
  consume a lot of time. With logging, you can leave a trail of 
  breadcrumbs so that if something goes wrong, we can determine 
  the cause of the problem.

Raising exceptions during logging can be useful in 
certain scenarios to indicate exceptional conditions or 
errors in your application.

# 	def log_func(*args): 
# 		logging.info( 
# 			'Running "{}" with arguments {}'.format(func.__name__,

# 	return x-y 

# add_logger = logger(add) 
# sub_logger = logger(sub) 

# add_logger(3, 3) 
# add_logger(4, 5) 

# sub_logger(10, 5) 
# sub_logger(20, 10) 

# output

'''
An important thing to note here, is that we can get to know what 
variables are stored inside a Closure with the help of 
the __closure__ attribute that makes use of Cell Objects to 
store the variables of the Outer Function and because of this, 
the closure can use these variables even when the Outer Function 
is terminated.
